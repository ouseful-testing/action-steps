# 1 Electronics everywhere


Electronics is the art of controlling the movement of electrons in order to design components and circuits that are put together to create the technology of the modern world. Increasingly electronics is at the cutting edge of technology, as illustrated in the following video.

This section of the course will introduce you to the sensing–logic–actuation cycle, the three aspects of which form the basis of understanding electronics.


## 1.1 Autonomous systems


Any autonomous system has three fundamental aspects: sensing the environment using sensors, reasoning through logic and information processing, and then interacting with the environment through actuators. Together, these are known as the *sensing–logic–actuation cycle*, as shown in Figure 1.


![At the bottom of this diagram is a narrow irregular horizontal shape representing the environment. Above it are three boxes, with the first one on the left, the third one on the right and the second one above and centred on the other two. The first box is labelled ‘Sensing’, the second box is labelled ‘Logic – reasoning, planning and control’, and the third box is labelled ‘Actuation’. Arrows connect the three boxes and the environment to form a continuous clockwise cycle from the environment to the sensing box to the logic box to the actuation box, and back to the environment again. This is the sensing–logic–actuation control cycle.](images/sensing-logic-actuation-t212_1-1-1.eps.jpg)


__Figure 1__  The sensing–logic–actuation control cycle for autonomous systems


Each of the three aspects of the sensing–logic–actuation cycle will be discussed briefly here.

Sensing
Electronic devices can sense the world, converting a wide variety of physical phenomena into electrical signals that communicate useful information. Such devices have capabilities similar to the five human senses: hearing (microphones), seeing (cameras), touch (piezoelectrics), and smell and taste (chemical sensors), although sometimes our human senses are better. However, electronic devices can sense things we cannot. For example, Figure 2 shows how ultrasound allows us to ‘see’ inside our bodies, infrared images allow us to ‘see’ patterns of heat and terahertz images allow us to see through opaque coverings.


![Part (a) is a black-and-white ultrasound image of a baby in the womb.Part (b) is a false colour picture of a house where the chimney and windows are red, showing areas of high heat loss, and the roof is blue, indicating low heat loss (presumably the roof is well insulated).Part (c) consists of three images of a tooth. On the left is a photograph of the tooth, while on the right are two false colour images showing internal features of the tooth.](images/ultrasound-infrared-terahertz-t212_1-1-2.eps.jpg)


__Figure 2__ Electronics allows us to perceive things beyond the human senses: (a) ultrasound image of an unborn baby; (b) infrared image of a house; (c) terahertz image of a tooth


The electrical signals generated by sensors can be processed in many useful ways. For instance, there are many sensors in modern cars linked to displays and alarms that inform the driver of the engine speed and temperature, whether or not the doors are properly shut, if all the passengers are wearing seatbelts, of the proximity of other vehicles when parking, and so on (Figure 3).

Logic
Sometimes the information from sensors is fed directly to a human being to act on, as in the car example. However, in many cases that information is unseen by humans and is used to control systems automatically. To do this requires the functions of reasoning and logic, which are usually carried out by logic circuits or programmable microprocessors (Figure 4). These decide what to do from one moment to the next and control the behaviour of the system.


![This is a photograph of a circuit board about 5 centimetres by 10 centimeters, with a large 3 centimetre square microprocessor chip.](images/microprocessor-t212_1-1-4.eps.jpg)

Actuation
Actuators are components that control the movement in an autonomous system. In many systems, actuators of various kinds are controlled to give the desired behaviour. These include electric motors of various kinds, and other means of motion such as pistons driven by compressed air.

For example, the Oxboard shown in Figure 5 has two motors. You will learn more about the Oxboard in Section 1.2.


![This is a photograph of the legs and feet of a person riding an Oxboard, showing the Oxboard in action from the front. The Oxboard has two wheels, one at either side, with each wheel connected to a small platform of appropriate size for a person’s foot. The board is narrower in the middle where the two platforms meet.](images/oxboard-t212_1-1-5.eps.jpg)

## 1.2 The sensing–logic–actuation cycle in practice


Watch the video below, which is a promotional video for Oxboard showing a child riding one of their two-wheeled devices. It is remarkable how the board responds to the way the rider moves his feet and body, and how controllable it is.

Figure 6 gives some of the details of the Oxboard’s construction and use.


![On the left of this image is a description of the Oxboard, as follows:The Oxboard is a personal transporter. It is a board with two wheels, one each side. Oxboard has two built-in motors fed by a battery pack. You can go forwards or backwards with the Oxboard but also take left or right-hand bends. The compact design also ensures that you can use the Oxboard both inside and outside.The Oxboard is a clever device that reacts to how your weight is distributed. The trick is in particular to relax when standing on the Oxboard; the Oxboard will then ensure the best balance. The Oxboard wil react directly if you distribute your weight ‘unevenly’; lean forward and you will move forwards, lean to the left and the Oxboard veers to the left. etc.On the right is a photograph of the Oxboard with the following components labelled: crash bumpers; rubber mat with sensors below that sense how you are leaning on the Oxboard; battery indicators; motor, wheels and tyres; LED lights; on button; connector for charger.](images/oxboard-description-t212_1-1-6.eps.jpg)


__Figure 6__  The Oxboard product description


Think about the sensing–logic–actuation cycle for the Oxboard transporter system. The board has sensors to detect the way the rider moves his feet and body. It uses logic to compute all the complicated forces associated with the motion; based on that information, it controls the two actuators (motor-driven wheels) to transport the rider in his desired direction.

### SAQ 1


#### Question

Draw a sensing–logic–actuation cycle for the Oxboard transporter using <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="">Figure 1</a> as a template.


#### Answer

A possible answer is shown in Figure 7.


![This is a sensing–logic–actuation cycle for the Oxboard. The sensing box contains the words ‘Sensors – detect position of rider, various forces, speed, etc.’ The logic box contains the words ‘Logic – calculation of forces, reasoning, planning and control used to decide what power to apply to the motors’. The actuation box contains the words ‘Actuation – the motors turn the wheels to create forces keeping the rider upright and moving in the desired direction’. The environment shape at the bottom contains the words ‘Environment – flat ground’ and ‘Rider in charge’, meaning that the rider is in the environment of the machine, and that the machine responds through its sensors to how the rider leans his body.](images/oxboard-sensing-logic-actuation-t212_1-1-7.eps.jpg)
