# Conclusion


In this free course, ‘An introduction to electronics’, you have been introduced to some of the fundamental ideas underlying electronics. You have considered the many ways in which electronics impinges on our lives, and looked into some of the technicalities. These included the basics of electrical and electronic circuits, including the use of voltage dividers and Wheatstone bridges to make sensor circuits. You also made a brief journey into the world of signals and signal processing, where electronics plays such a dominant role. Inevitably this course has only scratched the surface, but hopefully you have been inspired to continue your studies and learn more about this fascinating subject.
