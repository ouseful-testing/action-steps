# 2 Links between English and Latin


Although Latin is not the direct ancestor of the English language, as it is of languages such as Italian, French and Spanish (the so-called ‘Romance’ languages), it has nevertheless given us an enormous number of English words. According to some estimates, around half of all English words come from Latin.


## 2.1 Latin and English: the Roman empire


You may be familiar with the idea that words such as __science__, __transport__ and __solution__ are derived from Latin, but did you know that __street__ and __kipper__ come from Latin words which entered ordinary speech during the period from the first to the early fifth centuries AD, when Celtic Britain was part of the Roman empire?

## 2.2 The influence of Norman French


In the sixth century, the Latin of the Christian church added such words as __monastery__ and __minster, pope__ and __noon__ (from __nona hora__ = *ninth hour* = 3pm) to the language, which was then essentially Anglo-Saxon. When William the Conqueror and his Normans came to Britain in the eleventh century, a vast number of words, derived both from Norman French and from written Latin, entered English. Among these are __ duke, general, soldier, army, palace, law, chivalry, merchant, mutton, beef __ and __pork__. In some instances, English was further enriched by having two versions of what was originally a single Latin word.

## 2.3 The Renaissance to the modern era


The Renaissance in Europe, the Enlightenment in Britain, and the growth of science and technology in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, produced thousands more words derived from Latin, such as __ administration, computer, decimal, horticulture, interface, molecule, missile, satellite __ and __superhuman__.

This is a huge and fascinating topic. If you would like to think about it in greater depth, you could read *Latin in our Language* by Peter Barker − see the ‘ <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="">Further reading</a> ’ section for full publication details. This book contains many vocabulary exercises.

In English there are often two words expressing the same idea, one of Anglo-Saxon origin, the other of Latin origin. Anglo-Saxon words can often seem more simple and straightforward in style, while Latinate words can seem more scientific and academic. So simple words and phrases such as __go down, high, sad, speed up, watch, hate, do well__ and __hide__, for example, can be contrasted with words of Latin origin like __ descend, elevated, miserable, accelerate, observe, detest, succeed __ and __conceal__. But do bear in mind that not all words derived from Latin sound elevated: remember the homely words of Latin origin you met in <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="">Section 2</a>, like __cheese__, __peas__ and __sock__ !


### Activity 2


#### Question

data

things given

exit

he/she goes out

formula

rule/method

fungus

lens

lentil

media

things in the middle

plus

vacuum

empty thing




## 2.4 Latin vocabulary


The links between Latin and English vocabulary are good news for students of Latin. Because of the presence of so many words of Latin origin in English, many Latin words are relatively easy for English speakers to absorb. Indeed, some Latin words are almost identical to their English equivalents, as shown in Table 2.
<table xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings">

The fact that Latin words often have English derivatives can also make them relatively straightforward to learn.
