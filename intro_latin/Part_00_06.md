# Conclusion


We hope that you have enjoyed ‘Getting started on classical Latin’.

Simply by working through this free course, you have already begun to familiarise yourself with some of the key terms that you will meet again if you choose to learn Latin in earnest, such as ‘noun’, ‘verb’, ‘subject’ and ‘object’. Do bear in mind that you have been presented with a lot of information in a very short time and you are certainly not expected to retain everything that you have read. Getting to grips with the basic principles of grammar – which you have already done – is always going to be more important than memorising the precise terms used to describe grammatical concepts. And the good news is that when you meet these grammatical concepts again when you are studying Latin, your understanding will give you an important head start. Remember, too, that this course has a <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="">Glossary</a> if you need to refresh your memory of what certain grammatical terms mean.

Focusing on grammar is one aspect of language learning, but learning vocabulary is equally important; something else that we hope you have taken away from this course is just how strong the links between Latin and English are and, as a consequence, how similar many Latin words are to English words. You might like to take a moment to reflect on how many Latin words you are familiar with now that you’ve worked through this course.

If you enjoyed ‘Getting Started on classical Latin’, why not take your Latin learning further? For suggestions on what to do next, see the <a xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" href="">Further reading</a> section.
