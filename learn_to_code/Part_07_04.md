# 3 Summary


This week you’ve learned how to take a dataset that contains multiple possible groupings, or subsets of data, and work with those groups to perform a variety of transformations. You’ve explored:

* ways of grouping data

* Comtrade data

* the world of export data

* how to get data.

Next week looks at how to split the data contained in a dataframe into multiple groups based on the unique ‘key’ values in a single column, or unique combinations of values that appear across two or more columns.
