# 2 Early revolutions in sound recording


The kind of processes described in Section 1 are essentially those developed by the recording companies over the first century or so of sound recording. These processes were, in turn, shaped according to the technologies that were used.  The first part of this course traces the history of recording technology to around the end of the last century.


## 2.1 The pre-recording era


The first sound recording of a human voice, of the nursery rhyme ‘Mary Had a Little Lamb’, was made over 150 years ago. Within 25 years sound recording had become a global industry.

Before sound recording was possible, few people had the opportunity to hear music in the way we take for granted today. Apart from expensive musical boxes and mechanical music players, the only way music could be heard was in live performances. Take a moment to think how your life would be without being able to listen to music through a sound system, via the web, or in public places. How often would you listen to music if you could hear it only by attending performances or making it yourself? No two answers to this question will be the same, because each person’s experience would depend on where they lived, the kind of repertoire they might seek out and the resources at their disposal to travel, or to gain entrance to live events. The following activity pursues some of these ideas


### Activity 1 
__Timing: Allow about 10 minutes__


#### Question

Think of how people listened to music before the advent of sound recording. Try to put yourself in their place and make a list of the various ways in which you might hear music. Is there a common thread that you can discover about the experience?


#### Discussion

You might have thought of the following:

* places of religious worship (singing hymns, listening to the organ, etc.)

* at school (nursery rhymes, group songs and dance)

* in the home (listening to a singer, or instrument, perhaps accompanied by the piano)

* live organised musical events (listening to the band in a local park, going to the music hall, a classical concert or a musical theatre performance, for example)

* dancing (to music from local bands).

Of course, the sort of music to which people listened depended on their resources and social class, as well as where they lived, but a common thread that runs through the list above is that on many occasions music was created by people meeting together – at church, school or the local public house for example. Almost all of the music was live, with just the possibility of hearing a mechanical instrument such as a barrel organ. Of course, music was not necessarily heard only on occasions when several people met together – nursery rhymes, humming, or whistling generally have an audience of just one or two.



The evidence of historical listening accounts suggests that listeners in pre-recording eras heard a much less eclectic mixture of styles than we do today. We hear music in a great variety of places – for example, in shops, restaurants, bars, on television, in the car, at home, at concerts, etc. – so we are likely to be familiar with the sound of a range of, for example, popular music as well as orchestras, singing groups and musical styles from other cultures. Earlier listeners were much more constrained in the variety of music to which they were able to listen and what is interesting in some of their accounts is the impact of listening to unfamiliar styles. The nineteenth-century character Samuel Midgley illustrates the point. He was born in 1860, the son of a miner and shop-keeper, and had little experience of large-scale orchestral and choral sound, describing in his memoirs the rarity and wonder of hearing such a performance:

<!--Quote id=-->
>I had not been able to attend good concerts. Money was scarce, and more than once I had looked with longing eyes at the outside of [Bradford’s] St. George’s Hall when big concerts were in progress.
>One memorable evening, when the temptation was immensely strong, I quietly stole up the steps of the South gallery and listened outside the door to the glorious music.(Midgley, 1934, p. 16)

## 2.2 Edison

In 1877 the young American inventor Thomas Alva Edison (1847–1931) finally completed development of an invention capable of capturing, recording and playing back sounds. Edison called it the phonograph, from the Greek meaning ‘sound-writer’. It is pictured with the inventor in Figure 1.


### Activity 2 
__Timing: Allow about 10 minutes__


#### Question

Listen to the following track. It is a recording of Edison speaking the nursery rhyme ‘Mary Had a Little Lamb’ made in 1927, 50 years after he made his original recording in 1877 (none of his original 1877 recordings have survived). What are the most striking features of the recording?
<!--MEDIACONTENT--><!--ENDMEDIACONTENT-->

#### Discussion

The sound quality in the clip of Edison speaking that you have just listened to is very poor in comparison to what we have come to expect today. This is because the system used a recording method in which an individual shouted into a horn and the sound was transmitted onto a recording device (Figure 2). The fact a person had to shout indicates that the recording machine was very insensitive. This was due to the mechanical stiffness (inertia) of the mechanism that cut the groove into the recording medium, which in this case was tin-foil. This had a direct effect on the range of sound that could be recorded on mechanical recording machines.

## 2.3 Bell and Tainter

Figure 3 ‘Graphophone’ Gramophone with Horn and Cylinders, c.1900, English School, (20th century) 


Following his invention of the phonograph Edison took a break from working on recording technology. Alexander Graham Bell (1847–1922), who had risen to prominence through his invention of the telephone, set about developing a recording machine with the assistance of his cousin Chichester Bell (1848–1924), a chemical engineer, and Charles Tainter (1854–1940), a scientist and instrument maker. By 1887 Bell and Tainter had succeeded in producing a recording machine they called the graphophone (meaning ‘sound-pencil’). The graphophone was largely similar to the phonograph, but in place of tin-foil they used cylinders of hard wax coated onto cardboard sleeves as the recording medium. This was a great technical advance, for it not only gave much greater quality of reproduction but also allowed the recording to be replayed many times.


![figure images/a232_1_f04.tif](images/a232_1_f04.tif)


Figure 4 Mr Edison’s ‘Perfected Phonograph’, just received in London from New York (engraving), English School, (19th century)


When Edison returned to recording technology, his ‘Perfected Phonograph’ looked remarkably similar to the graphophone. However, Edison used a solid wax cylinder rather than a wax-coated cardboard sleeve. This allowed the cylinder surface to be shaved, erasing the original recording and allowing the cylinder to be re-used. 

The Columbia Phonograph Company recorded popular songs of the day on cylinders. They could be played back using specially adapted ‘coin-in-the-slot’ phonographs, which were situated in public places such as drugstores and saloons. Popular songs could be heard ‘for a nickel a time’. Their popularity demonstrated a public demand for recorded music.

By Christmas 1897 a $10 clockwork-powered graphophone was offered. To compete, Edison offered his clockwork-powered ‘Home Phonograph’ for $20 which, apart from minor modifications, sold for over 30 years.


## 2.4 Berliner


Emile Berliner (1851–1929) became interested in recording sound through studying a device called the phonoautograph. This apparatus inscribed sound vibrations as a lateral trace onto lamp-blacked paper using a diaphragm and stylus. Berliner thought that this lateral motion could offer superior recording quality to Edison’s vertical method. He also decided to use a disc, which he called a plate, which was rotated at a fixed speed, rather than a cylinder as the recording medium. This overall design was sufficiently different from the phonograph to allow it to be patented in 1887 using the name gramophone.

Berliner made his plates from a tough rubber-based compound called vulcanite, allowing for a deep groove. This deep groove allowed cheap, replaceable steel needles to be used in place of the delicate jewel stylus found in the cylinder machines. This made the gramophone (Figure 5) cheaper to manufacture than the competition. In 1894 Berliner’s United States Gramophone Company released their first single-sided 7 inch (18 cm) diameter disc.

An important point to note is that unlike its rivals, the gramophone had no means of recording sounds – it was designed from the outset only to play back pre-recorded sounds. This demonstrated a high degree of faith by Berliner that people would be happy just to listen to sounds (and music in particular) in their own homes.


### Activity 3 
__Timing: Allow about 10 minutes__


#### Question

Listen to these two tracks. The first track contains an original recording by Emile Berliner made in 1889 and this is followed in the second track by a repeat of Edison’s recording that you have heard already. Remember that this recording of Edison was made in 1927, 50 years after his first attempt. How do you think Berliner’s recording compares with that of Edison? How would you describe the differences?
<!--MEDIACONTENT--><!--ENDMEDIACONTENT--><!--MEDIACONTENT--><!--ENDMEDIACONTENT-->

#### Discussion

The recording by Berliner was taken from an original 5 inch (13 cm) diameter vulcanite disc. I think you will agree that the reproduction is poor compared with the recording of Edison; the distortion and noise make the words spoken by the voice barely audible. Edison’s recording gives the voice much greater clarity. Even so, it still suffers from a limited frequency range and the noise which is concomitant with the level of technology with which it was produced.



Berliner was aware that Edison had problems duplicating cylinders. Initially copies were made from a master cylinder using a mechanical engraving process. Unfortunately this method caused the master cylinder to wear out after making just a few copies, so performers had to be asked to record several masters to ensure enough cylinders could be duplicated. An improved recording system allowed multiple master cylinders to be made by feeding several recording phonographs from one horn, but the cylinder-copying process was still far from satisfactory.

It took Berliner six years to perfect disc duplication but it was time well spent, for the principles are still used today to manufacture CDs. 

The owners of the original hand-cranked gramophones were instructed that the standard velocity for ‘seven-inch plates’ was about 70 revolutions per minute. The owner was also warned that failure to turn the plate at the correct speed would lead to a lowering of the pitch if turned too slow, or a raising of the pitch if turned too fast. It is doubtful if true reproduction of the recorded sound was ever achieved by the owners of these machines! A better power source was needed and as electric motors were far too costly, a suitably powerful and inexpensive clockwork motor was used. It was designed and built by Eldridge Johnson (1867–1945), who would later form Victor Talking Machines and Victor Records, which would become RCA-Victor. The clockwork motor proved an immediate success, Christmas 1896 seeing the Berliner Gramophone Company of Washington, DC ahead of all the competition, with the factory being unable to keep up with the demand. By mid-1897 the ‘Improved Gramophone’, with a new Johnson-designed motor and soundbox, was launched. This model was destined to become one of the most familiar icons in the recorded music field for it was immortalised, along with a small dog called Nipper, in a painting by Francis Barraud (Figure 6). The painting became the trademark of the HMV (His Master’s Voice) Company in Europe and Victor Records in the USA.

The recording and playback speed would ultimately be standardised at 78 revolutions per minute (rpm), although recording speeds varied from under 70 to over 80 rpm. To cater for these differences a speed controller was fitted to most gramophones.

Disc diameters also varied, but 7-inch (18 cm) playing for two minutes, 10-inch (25 cm) playing for three minutes, and eventually 12-inch (30 cm) playing for up to five minutes became standard. Eventually recordings were put on both sides of the disc – known then, as now, as the A and B sides – offering better value and greater convenience to users.


## 2.5 Popularising recordings

The limitations of the recording techniques discussed so far restricted the sounds that could be reproduced. Instruments tended to be limited to brass and piano, and middle-register voices (alto and tenor) were the most suitable. So why did the disc succeed over the cylinder? The answer has little to do with technology and much more to do with the tenor Enrico Caruso.


### Activity 4 
__Timing: Allow about 10 minutes__


#### Question

Listen to this track. It is a recording of Enrico Caruso (1873–1921) singing ‘Questa o quella’ from the opera Rigoletto by Verdi (1813–1901). This was the second of ten recordings made by the recording engineer and important early recording producer Fred Gaisberg in March 1902. What extraneous sounds can you hear in this recording?
<!--MEDIACONTENT--><!--ENDMEDIACONTENT-->

#### Discussion

In addition to the music you may notice that Caruso clears his throat at the end of the first verse (around 1:03 in the recording), which underlines a fundamental difference between early recordings and their later counterparts – no editing facilities were available. This recording has been restored by Ward Marston (we will return to the issue of recording restoration in a later section).




## 2.6 Good times and bad

By 1924 the burgeoning of radio broadcasting in the United States proved of great importance to the record industry. The sensitive microphones and electronic amplifiers used in broadcast studios offered improved characteristics that were exploited in the record industry through the development of an electromagnetic cutting head by the American company Western Electric. Electric players rapidly replaced the older machines, as they were able to exploit the improved characteristics of the electric recordings. In particular, the new recordings were able to use equalisation (i.e., the process whereby the volumes of specific parts of the audio spectrum are altered relative to the other parts of the sound) to improve the replayed sound quality.

Following the Second World War (1939–1945), demand for records increased dramatically. An example of the upsurge is demonstrated by the figures for sales of an early recording of a popular piano concerto, which sold 102 copies in 1935 and 62,756 copies in 1946. Consumers, though, were no longer satisfied with excerpts of symphonies or musical works shortened to fit to one or two sides of a disc. Record companies began to make full-scale symphonies and choral works available as sets, but the recording media were not particularly convenient or conducive to an enjoyable musical experience. For example, Bach’s St Matthew Passion (approximately 3 hours of music) came on eighteen double-sided 12-inch records, but listening to this work involved changing records 36 times!

In 1948 Peter Goldmark (1906–1977), head of research at Columbia Records in America, demonstrated a 12-inch (30 cm) non-breakable microgroove vinyl disc capable of playing 23 minutes each side. Columbia called it the LP (for long-playing) disc. It revolved at 33⅓ rpm with up to 300 tracks to the inch (120 per cm). The rival company RCA-Victor seemed not to be impressed with the LP. They responded with a 7-inch (18 cm) microgroove vinyl disc that revolved at 45 rpm, the so-called 45, which had a similar track pitch to the LP and played for up to 4 minutes. The ‘Battle of the Speeds’ commenced.

Fortunately for the record companies a truce was declared by 1950, with the 78 rpm disc the loser. The LP was adopted for classical recordings and the 45 for popular music. In Europe the change took a little longer, but by the end of 1952 LPs were available from European manufacturers.

The LP is not quite the end of the story of the gramophone record. As far back as 1931, the British engineer Alan Blumlein (1903-1942) designed and patented a stereo recording system that used two sound channels to create a virtual sound ‘stage’ where an individual sound source (instrument, voice, etc.) could be located at any point between two loudspeakers placed at the front left and front right of the listener. The location of the source is determined by the relative intensity in the two channels. The patent covered two possible ways of cutting the groove in the record to allow two separate channels to be recorded.

This brings to a close the story of the record (cylinder and disc), the main source of recorded sound for nearly a hundred years. Apart from refining manufacturing techniques, little change to the technology took place. Despite the recent up-turn in sales of vinyl recordings, other means of reproducing sound have long since come to the fore.
