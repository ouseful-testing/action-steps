# Conclusion


The recording world today is a thoroughly mixed economy. Some people’s experience of recording and of recorded music is exclusively through their computers, whereas the experience of others is through much more traditional means – the relatively recent rise in sale of vinyl discs, for example, is noteworthy. Some knowledge of all of the technologies developed in the twentieth century is therefore necessary for an understanding of the range of processes involved in recording today. In this free course, *Recording music and sound*, you have developed an understanding of the history of recording and have gained some appreciation for the kinds of issues that you would need to consider were you to make your recordings.
